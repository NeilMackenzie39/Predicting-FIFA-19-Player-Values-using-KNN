    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a [project](https://github.com/NeilMackenzie39/Predicting-Car-Prices-using-KNN) on the use of KNN to predict car prices, I decided to try combining the use of machine learning with one of my passions: soccer. In this project I will use the skills I have learnt thus far in the Dataquest.io 'Data Scientist in Python' [course](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/) to build a model that will predict the value of a player in FIFA 19 based on 10 of the player's attributes. The players will be categorized as forwards, midfielders, defenders and goalkeepers and the 10 best features to predict a player's value for each category will be identified and used to make predictions for players belonging to each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps used are summarised below:\n",
    "1. Preview the dataset\n",
    "2. Perform data cleaning to reduce the size of the dataset and remove null values\n",
    "3. Convert columns containing numerical information in string format to integer/float format\n",
    "4. Assign numerical information to categorical data\n",
    "5. Normalize the data\n",
    "6. Categorize players as forwards, midfielders, defenders or goalkeepers\n",
    "6. Identify 10 most accurate attributes to predict player value for each category\n",
    "7. Predict the value of players in each category using only the top 10 features identifed in (6)\n",
    "8. Plot and analyze the results\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of this project is to practice the implementation of KNN. The price of each player in the game is already known so there is no need to predict their value. Nonetheless, running trough this code will be useful to practice the impemenation of a KNN model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this project is completed, I intend to use the skills I have learned to build a model that will predict the price of custom stainless steel components that are designed at my current company. My intention is to use KNN to predict a component's price based on its complexity and identify how we can reduce the cost of components by reducing the presence/number of features that add to the cost significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also intend to expand on this project by using linear regression to predict the value of a player and compare the accuracy achieved between KNN and linear regression. This will be done in a future project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete dataset for players in FIFA 2019 is available on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) Kaggle page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with step 1 above"

    "With better knowledge about the implementation of KNN, I now intend to build a model to analyze which attributes of stainless steel components designed at my current job contribute to their cost most significantly. This information can  be used to a) reduce the complexity of our designs to reduce cost and b) predict the cost of a component based on its design features."
